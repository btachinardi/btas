Dear [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME or "Hiring Team"],

[WHY_THIS_COMPANY - Reference their stage, mission, or specific problem. Example: "I've been following [COMPANY] since [CONTEXT] - your approach to [PROBLEM] mirrors challenges I tackled building Fofuuu, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring that experience to your team."]

I build products from zero to one. Over 15 years, I've founded companies, taken ideas from whiteboard to funded product, and worn every hat from sole developer to CEO. I've secured R$1.5M+ in funding, won 9 awards, and published research - but more importantly, I've shipped products that helped real users.

Most recently, I've been building across multiple domains: an NIH-funded biomedical data platform (BiomedHub), an AI embryo classification system for IVF clinics (EmbryoLabs, 68% faster processing), and a farm management platform using WhatsApp + AI transcription (HerdU). Each was a 0-to-1 build with tight constraints and real users.

I co-founded Fofuuu and scaled it over 9 years - from solo prototype to 2,500+ therapy activities serving thousands of families. I secured funding from Samsung Creative Startups and Finep, led a clinical study showing 17% faster skill acquisition, and built PhoneNet (91.54% accuracy phoneme classifier, 12M samples). When our B2C model proved unsustainable, I made the hard call to wind down responsibly - learning that knowing when to pivot matters as much as persistence.

I'm looking to bring founder-level ownership to [an early-stage team / a growth-stage company] where I can [SPECIFIC_CONTRIBUTION - e.g., "architect the technical foundation" or "scale what's working while maintaining velocity"]. I thrive in environments where I can move fast, make decisions, and see direct impact.

I'd love to discuss how my experience could contribute to [COMPANY_NAME]'s next phase.

Best regards,
Bruno Tachinardi
