Dear [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME or "Hiring Team"],

[WHY_THIS_COMPANY - Be specific about the team, product, or technical challenge. Example: "I'm drawn to [TEAM/PRODUCT] because [SPECIFIC_REASON] - the intersection of [TECHNICAL_AREA] and [IMPACT_AREA] is where I've spent my career."]

I build systems that scale. Over 15 years, I've architected clinical AI platforms, led deep learning research, and built products serving thousands of users - always focused on measurable outcomes and technical rigor.

Currently, I'm lead developer on an NIH R35 grant, architecting BiomedHub - a distributed biomedical data platform with three-layer architecture (Discovery, Harmonization, Analysis), FHIR/MEDS interoperability, and Model Context Protocol integration for AI agents. The system serves multiple interfaces: web UI for researchers, Python libraries for data scientists, and containerized Nextflow pipelines for reproducible analysis.

I built EmbryoLabs, an AI embryo classification platform where I optimized video processing from 13.2s to 4.2s (68% reduction) through algorithm optimization and parallel processing. I developed a novel multi-score frame selection algorithm using Laplacian variance, LBP entropy, and KMeans clustering, with dual deployment strategies for cloud (Azure) and on-premise GPU-accelerated installations.

**Technical depth:** TypeScript, Python, React, Node.js/NestJS, .NET Core, TensorFlow/Keras, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Docker, Azure/GCP/AWS, FHIR/MEDS, LangChain, OpenAI API, RAG pipelines.

My founder background (9 years building Fofuuu, R$1.5M raised, 2,500+ therapy activities, published ML research with 91.54% accuracy) taught me to balance technical excellence with shipping. I consulted for Nubank on gamified loyalty, applying product thinking to a 50M+ user base.

I'm seeking roles where I can focus on deep technical work within a larger platform - bringing entrepreneurial ownership without the operational overhead. [SPECIFIC_REASON_THIS_TEAM].

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I could contribute to [COMPANY_NAME].

Best regards,
Bruno Tachinardi
