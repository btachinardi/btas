Dear [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME or "Hiring Team"],

[WHY_THIS_COMPANY - 1-2 sentences about what specifically draws you to this company. Be genuine. Reference their product, mission, recent news, or a specific problem they're solving.]

I build technology that transforms how people heal and learn. Over 15 years, I've founded healthcare startups, architected clinical AI systems, and led teams from prototype to published research - securing R$1.5M+ in funding and clinical validation along the way.

[CHOOSE_RECENT_WORK - Pick 2-3 most relevant to this role:]

Currently, I'm lead developer on an NIH R35 grant, architecting BiomedHub - an open-source biomedical data hub with FHIR/MEDS interoperability and Model Context Protocol integration for AI agents. Previously, I built EmbryoLabs, an AI embryo classification platform that reduced video processing time by 68% (13.2s to 4.2s) for IVF clinics. Most recently, I designed HerdU's multi-tenant architecture using WhatsApp integration and RAG-based AI transcription.

[FOUNDER_STORY - Condense based on relevance:]

I co-founded Fofuuu, scaling it to 2,500+ therapy activities serving thousands of families across Brazil. Our clinical study with Unimed demonstrated 17% faster skill acquisition (31% peak), and PhoneNet - my deep learning phoneme classifier - achieved 91.54% accuracy on 12M voice samples. I implemented HIPAA and LGPD compliance, led the team through pandemic pivots, and made the hard decision to wind down when unit economics proved unsustainable - learning that knowing when to stop matters as much as knowing how to build.

[WHY_NOW - Optional: 1 sentence on why you're seeking this type of role:]

I'm seeking [ROLE_TYPE] where I can combine technical architecture with product leadership - [SPECIFIC_REASON_THIS_COMPANY].

I bring a founder's mindset: ownership, pragmatism, and relentless focus on impact. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience could contribute to [COMPANY_NAME].

Best regards,
Bruno Tachinardi
