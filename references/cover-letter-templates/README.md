# Cover Letter Templates

These templates are designed to be customized for each specific opportunity. **Never send a generic cover letter** - always personalize the `[PLACEHOLDERS]` for each company.

## Template Structure

Each template follows this structure (~300 words):

1. **Hook** (2-3 sentences) - Who you are + why THIS company
2. **Recent Impact** (4-5 sentences) - Lead with most relevant recent work
3. **Founder Story** (4-5 sentences) - Condensed journey with concrete metrics
4. **Close** (2-3 sentences) - What you're looking for + call to action

## Available Templates

| Template | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| `base.md` | Starting point - all placeholders visible |
| `healthcare-biotech.md` | Healthcare companies, biotech, clinical software, research orgs |
| `startup.md` | Early-stage (Seed/Series A), growth-stage startups |
| `big-tech.md` | FAANG, large tech companies, enterprise software |

## How to Use

1. Choose the template closest to your target company
2. Copy it to a new file named for the company (e.g., `anthropic-2025.md`)
3. Fill in all `[PLACEHOLDERS]`
4. Review the "Why this company" section - make it genuine
5. Adjust emphasis based on the role (more technical vs more leadership)
