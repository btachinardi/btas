Dear [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME or "Hiring Team"],

[WHY_THIS_COMPANY - Reference their clinical focus, patient impact, or specific healthcare challenge they're addressing. Example: "Your work on [SPECIFIC_PRODUCT] resonates with my years building clinical software - I understand both the technical complexity and the responsibility of systems that affect patient outcomes."]

I build technology that transforms patient care. Over 15 years, I've founded healthcare startups, architected clinical AI systems, and led teams from prototype to published research - implementing HIPAA and LGPD compliance while securing clinical validation.

Currently, I'm lead developer on an NIH R35 grant, architecting BiomedHub - an open-source biomedical data hub for sepsis research with FHIR/MEDS interoperability, differential privacy, and Model Context Protocol integration for AI agents. I'm designing multi-interface systems serving both non-technical researchers and data scientists, with containerized Nextflow pipelines for reproducible analysis.

Previously, I built EmbryoLabs, an AI embryo classification platform for IVF clinics. I designed video processing pipelines that reduced processing time by 68% (13.2s to 4.2s), developed a novel multi-score frame selection algorithm, and implemented dual deployment strategies for cloud and on-premise installations - understanding that healthcare data often can't leave the building.

I co-founded Fofuuu, a clinically-validated autism therapy platform. We scaled to 2,500+ therapy activities serving thousands of families, and our clinical study with Unimed demonstrated 17% faster skill acquisition (31% peak improvement). I led PhoneNet, a deep learning phoneme classifier achieving 91.54% accuracy on 12M voice samples, published at the Brazilian Congress of Speech Therapy.

I understand that healthcare software requires balancing innovation velocity with rigorous validation and regulatory compliance. I'm seeking roles where I can combine deep technical work with clinical impact - [SPECIFIC_REASON_THIS_COMPANY].

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience building clinical software could contribute to [COMPANY_NAME].

Best regards,
Bruno Tachinardi
