I build technology that transforms how people work, heal, and learn. Over 15+ years, I have founded companies, architected complex systems, and led teams through pivots, pandemics, and product launches—always focused on delivering measurable value.

At Fofuuu, I designed and built patient management systems for autism therapy clinics, including claims-based access control, remote activity monitoring, clinical dashboards, AI-driven adaptive therapy plans, and analytics pipelines. This work resulted in a published clinical study and a platform that serves therapists and families across Brazil ([1 Minute Product Showcase](https://youtu.be/LYUtFdxuQds)).

These experiences taught me that successful products address specific user needs, whether alleviating pain points like cost and time, or amplifying gains like revenue and satisfaction. I lead teams with a culture of experimentation: distinguishing hypotheses from validated insights, aligning around shared objectives, and making data-driven decisions.

I started programming at 13, teaching myself to build tools and games. That early curiosity laid the foundation for everything that followed.

My entrepreneurial path began with **Betri Studio**, where I grew into a product manager and full-stack developer. I led projects including an HR expense system with OCR invoice scanning, a gamified rewards app integrated with sales performance metrics that drove engagement and revenue growth, and immersive digital training experiences for enterprise clients.

I co-founded **Fofuuu** to tackle digital health, building prototypes and MVPs for speech therapy activities. I developed real-time sound signal analysis systems and managed large-scale development efforts. Our work earned the [Best Educational Game Award (BIG Festival/BNDES)](https://gizmodo.uol.com.br/com-premio-no-big-festival-fofuu-mostra-que-games-podem-ser-mui) and the [Health Entrepreneurship Award (Sirio-Libanes Institute and Everis Brazil)](https://www.pptasaude.com.br/noticias/3501/startup-fofuuu-e-vencedora-do-premio-empreend).

After securing funding and transitioning to a dedicated CTO role, I led the development of Fofuuu Fono, a gamified digital therapy platform for speech therapists and caregivers. In partnership with Unifesp's Speech Therapy Ambulatory, I supervised a clinical study published at the [16th Congress of the Otorhinolaryngology Foundation](https://www.forl.org.br/).

I directed the **PhoneNet** project, a deep learning model for isolated phoneme classification designed to run on mobile devices. I led the full lifecycle: implementing a ResNet-based architecture with international collaborators, orchestrating a nationwide campaign to collect and label phoneme samples, and publishing findings at the [26th CBFa](https://www.sbfa.org.br/).

When Fofuuu pivoted to broader autism therapies, I took on dual CEO and CTO responsibilities. I secured funding from [Samsung Creative Startups](https://news.samsung.com/br/samsung-acelera-startup-que-estimula-a-fala-das-criancas-com-jo) and a larger round from [Finep Startup](https://finep.gov.br/), then led the design of Fofuuu Edu, expanding to Behavioral Psychology, Psycho-pedagogy, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy.

When the pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery, I adapted our platform for remote therapy sessions and secured funding from the [Covid-19 Rapid Innovation Cycle (City of Sao Paulo)](https://revistapegn.globo.com/Startups/noticia/2020/04/prefeitura-de-sp-anuncia-startups-que-) and the [Santander X Tomorrow Challenge](https://www.santanderx.com/en/blog/fofuuu-tricia-araujo-bruno-tachinardi). I transitioned the team to remote work and guided the company through restructuring during the industry-wide financial crisis.

When our B2C model proved unsustainable, I made the difficult decision to restructure and pause operations. I then joined **Nubank** as a product consultant, applying my entrepreneurial experience to a gamified loyalty program, providing strategic UX insights and supporting the project manager in aligning the initiative with business objectives.

## Recent Projects

**BiomedHub** (January 2025 - Present) - Lead software developer consultant for an NIH R35 grant. I am architecting an open-source biomedical data hub for sepsis research, featuring a three-layer architecture (Discovery, Harmonization, Analysis), a Model Context Protocol layer for AI agents, and healthcare interoperability standards including FHIR and MEDS.

**EmbryoLabs** (May 2024 - April 2025) - Architected and built an AI-powered embryo classification platform for IVF clinics from scratch. I designed video processing pipelines that achieved a 68% reduction in processing time, developed a novel multi-score frame selection algorithm, and implemented dual deployment strategies for cloud and on-premise installations. The platform helps embryologists assess embryo quality and improve clinical outcomes.

**HerdU** (August 2025 - January 2026) - Designed a farm management platform connecting managers and field workers through WhatsApp integration. I built a multi-tenant architecture with WhatsApp Business API integration, enabling field workers to submit audio reports transcribed by AI using OpenAI Whisper.

Throughout my career, I have applied technology to create meaningful change, from e-learning and gamification to digital health and AI-powered clinical tools. I build systems that enhance lives, empower users, and deliver measurable business results.

I am looking for opportunities where I can combine technical depth with product leadership to solve complex problems. Whether architecting systems, leading teams, or guiding product strategy, I bring a founder's mindset: ownership, pragmatism, and a relentless focus on impact.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience can contribute to your team.
