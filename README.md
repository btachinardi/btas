I build technology that transforms how people work, heal, and learn. Over 15+ years, I have founded companies, architected complex systems, and led teams through pivots, pandemics, and product launches -- always focused on delivering measurable value.

This repository is both my **professional portfolio** and a showcase of how I approach engineering: structured data models, clean architecture, multilingual support, and purpose-built tooling.

## Featured Projects

### BiomedHub -- Biomedical Data Discovery Hub
**Lead Software Developer Consultant** | 2025 -- Present | Remote (NIH R35 Grant)

Architecting an open-source biomedical data hub for sepsis research at the University of Cincinnati. The platform unifies clinical and multi-omics datasets through FHIR, MEDS, and Croissant standards across three layers: Discovery, Harmonization, and Analysis. Designed multi-interface access for researchers (web UI), data scientists (Python libraries), and AI agents (Model Context Protocol).
